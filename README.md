DDA game artefact implmented using Q-learning algorithm. Created for MSc dissertation.
The visual stuio solution does not have all the intermediate files on this repoistory due to absurdly large individual file size.

The indivdual class files can be observed as standalone .cpp and .h files.

C++ code can be found at 

Source\DDA_BossFight\Private\RLGameInstance.cpp 

and 

Source\DDA_BossFight\Public\RLGameInstance.h
